### Solutions for [Rosalind's code problems](http://rosalind.info/)

- All solution written pure Python, no third party packages.
- My main goals here are: 1) write readable code 2) try FP style code 3) learn bio-info.
- Scripts must be execute in the base directory (`rosalind/`), `dat/` directory contains problem's inputs.
- All code formated with black.
- The example given in the problem is always asserted before computing the main result.
- No imports from other scripts in the repository.
